                - Check out React Documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html
                - For this component, feel free to propose an appropriate API via props that you need to display the info.
                - Create a dummy data for development purpose for now first.
                - Propose what information would be useful to show for each node (request, endpoint, etc).
                - Read up SemantiUI React library and browse the components that can help you implement it. (https://react.semantic-ui.com/) */}
