                - Check out React Documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html
                - For LogsBar, we are going to have the props called logs.
                - The structure of the logs props data can be found in App.js.
                - To access logs inside the component, use the attribute this.props.logs.
                - Start changing the content of the LogsBar html here.
                - Read up SemantiUI React library and browse the components that can help you implement it. (https://react.semantic-ui.com/) */}
